# Computer Vision

A collection of computer vision projects completed for CS 455 - Computer Vision at BYU. These projects demonstrate fundamental and advanced computer vision techniques through practical implementations.

## Projects

### Project 1: Edge Detection and Hough Transform (`proj1-edges-hough/`)
Implementation of edge detection algorithms and Hough transform for line detection in images.

### Project 2: Image Segmentation (`proj2-segmentation/`)
Interactive image segmentation using foreground/background seeds with GUI tools. Includes `guiseg.py` for manual annotation of training data.

### Project 3: Image Stitching (`proj3-stitching/`)
Panoramic image creation through feature matching and geometric transformations.

### Project 4: QR Code Reader (`proj4-qrreader/`)
Complete QR code detection and decoding system from scratch.
